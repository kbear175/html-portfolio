<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>

<p>I am blessed with three amazing sons, have been married for more than 30 years to my talented husband Gary, have had the same best friends for 50 years, and been in the same book club for 25 years (love reading!). I have an aeronautical engineering degree, and worked over 30 years as a registered patent agent.</p>
<p>I feel a lot of empathy for animals, I've been vegan for almost 5 years. I volunteer with the Center for Animal Litigation and am looking to also volunteer with Every Bunny Counts.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning new things.  Currently I am taking lessons to play the bagpipes and I have a 160 day streak on DuoLingo to learn Spanish. And learning coding too, of course!</p>
